 FS TechDegree Project #4
 
Project inculded html, css as setup. Also inculded was an animated file for animations.
For 'Exceeds Expectations, 3 animations from this file are called:

bounceIn on 'qwerty' class on name change of 'chosen'
bounceOut on 'qwerty' class on name change of 'wrong'
fadeOutRight heart image 'li' emement on class name change of 'broken-heart'

Also for 'Exceeds Expectations,' a transform is set to the 'phrase' 'li' elements load in by changing the background color via js script.

The phrase 'li' elements include a 180deg transform when the player makes a correct letter play.

The 'styles.css' :root --transition constant duration parameter has been increased to '1.5s' This has the effect of build-ins of elements when they change. One change is when the user resets the game, the 'qwerty' keyboard will have a wipe affect/reset from the previous game's keyboard.
